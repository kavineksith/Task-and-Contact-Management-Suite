# üóÇÔ∏è Task Planner

A command-line based task management system in Python that allows users to **create**, **update**, **search**, **list**, and **backup** tasks with structured fields like priority, due date, category, and status.

## üìå Introduction

Task Planner is a simple yet powerful CLI tool that helps individuals and teams organize their tasks efficiently. It supports persistent storage through CSV files, backups, and interactive prompts for managing task lifecycles.

Key features:

* Create, view, update, and delete tasks
* Assign priorities and due dates
* Organize by category and track status
* Backup task data automatically
* Simple CSV-based storage for easy portability
* Extensible architecture using abstract base classes and enums

## üöÄ Usage

### Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* No external dependencies

### Running the App

```bash
python task_manager.py
```

Once launched, you'll see a menu with options like:

```
1. Add Task
2. Delete Task
3. Update Task
4. List Tasks
5. Search Tasks
6. Backup Tasks
7. Exit
```

### Task Fields

* `Title` (required)
